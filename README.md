# Chortle
## Inspiration
I've been enjoying the short daily games, the "dles" as many people like to call them, and I wanted to make my own. I enjoy that it takes so quick to complete one game, but I still love that it stretches my brain a little. 

## What it does
You play two games at once: a chess puzzle and Wordle. Every turn, you guess a word and a chess move. Both letters in the chess move are in the secret word, but they can appear in any order. For example, if the word is “DREAM” and the move is e4d3, they share the letter D and E.

## How we built it
It was built with Svelte and deployed on Netlify.

## Challenges we ran into
Doing this project solo was challenging. I had to conceive of the idea and look for people such as mentors or my fellow hackers to validate/critique them and to playtest the product at different stages. Coding it all by myself was also an interesting challenge, as I had all the control of the project architecture.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am really proud that I was able to take an idea from conception to completion. I am also happy that it is something I enjoy and would love to actually use.

## What we learned
This was mostly a refresher in Svelte, and I can see that I can work faster and have improved. As for something new, it's a bit niche, but I can now set up a chessboard in Svelte.

## What's next for Chortle
Right now, it's randomly creating games to streamline the demo process, but I will make it function like the other dles, where it resets every day, as that is how I enjoy these types of games.
